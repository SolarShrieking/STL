# Stellaris <- Twitch -> List

__To Whomever Finds This:__
Apparently, Twitch has a new API. I haven't looked at it, and I have no idea if this will work or not. If it does, enjoy. Otherwise, let me know and I'll consider updating it!

This was written before I had committed to writing any sort of decent human-readable code, and anyone using it or modifying it should be aware of this fact. If you choose to look within the contents of this project, consider yourself warned. What lies ahead is enough spaghetti code to make even the worst of devs die a little bit on the inside.

Transcribe your Twitch Subscribers/Followers into a Stellaris namelist file for endless fun!

#Download
You can download the jarfile [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3pzisl58a2t1489/STL.jar?dl=1).


#Instructions
* Place the jar in a directory, it doesn't matter where. Hopefully.
* Run the executable jar
* Enter your Twitch name, and press "Authenticate"
* Log in and allow STL access.
* Wait for STL to process your list. The max request usually only takes <30s or so.
* The *yourUsername.txt* will be sitting in the same directory as the jar.
* Place the resulting file in **\yourSteamDir\Steam\steamapps\common\Stellaris\common\name_lists**
* Stream!

#Planned Features
* Selectable namelist options -- only get subs/followers for specific entries
* Automatic updating on Stellaris launch -- convert to mod?
* Place file within Stellaris Directory automatically
* etc
* I have plans to clean the entire project up soon with better implementation and coding style, as I wrote this when I was not that great with the language. It is still functional in its current state, but should not be considered quality. ;)
