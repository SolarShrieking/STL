# Stellaris <- Twitch -> List

Transcribe your Twitch Subscribers into a Stellaris namelist file for endless fun!

**more documentation coming soon

**things are ~~probably~~ broken right now

#Download
You can download the jarfile [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3pzisl58a2t1489/STL.jar?dl=1) 
Please keep in mind this won't work if you don't have subscribers on your twitch acct, and
even then, it might not work.


#Instructions
* Place the jar in a directory, it doesn't matter where. Hopefully.
* Run the executable jar
* Enter your Twitch name, and press "Authenticate"
* Log in and allow STL access.
* Wait for STL to process your list. The max request usually only takes <30s or so.
* The *yourUsername.txt* will be sitting in the same directory as the jar.
* Place the resulting file in **\yourSteamDir\Steam\steamapps\common\Stellaris\common\name_lists**
* Stream!
